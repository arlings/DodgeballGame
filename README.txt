# DodgeballGame
This is a dodgeball game that I created through the use of JavaScript, and it contains a full repository that has been formatted specifically for github. It is a two-player game, players must use WASD and the arrow keys to navigate and eliminate their foe!
This is playable only on one device, player 1 using WASD and player 2 using the arrow keys. I created the game using Khan Academy's online JS emulator, so there may be SOME bugs running it on specific IDE's. I have not tried it on an IDE yet, so try it at your own risk!
The specific pellets scattered around the map can give different powerups, collect them and find what powers they have to offer.
To install, just download the JS file titled MainGame.js, and run it in an IDE or online emulator, with a friend of course.
If you want to add anything to this game, feel free to do so, so long as Arlind Zalli (me) is credited for the original version. This is quite a basic game so I wouldn't expect anyone to add anything to it in the future. If you do, also feel free to send the new revision to me directly at arlindzalli2@gmail.com !
